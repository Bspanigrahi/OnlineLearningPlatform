# OnlineLearningPlatform


I developed a Full-Stack Online Learning Platform that streamlines course management and user interactions. This project showcases my expertise in Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, and front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

ğŸ”¹ Tech Stack:
âœ” Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
âœ” Backend: Spring Boot, Hibernate
âœ” Database: MySQL
âœ” Architecture: MVC

ğŸ”¹ Key Features & Modules:
ğŸ”¸ Admin Module â€“ Manage courses, add/remove trainers, and oversee users.
ğŸ”¸ User Module â€“ User registration, login, and profile management.
ğŸ”¸ Course Module â€“ Course creation, assignment to trainers, and deletion.
ğŸ”¸ Trainer Module â€“ Trainers can be added or removed by admin.
ğŸ”¸ Authentication & Authorization â€“ Secure login, role-based access.

ğŸ”¹ Database Design:
User Table (stores user details, linked to courses via foreign key).
Course Table (maintains course details).
Trainer Table (stores trainer information).
ğŸš€ Impact & Learning:
Used Hibernate for ORM and efficient database handling.
